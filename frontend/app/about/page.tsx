      <p className="text-slate-600 mb-3">
        Amurtha Bharathi foundation is envisioned for individual integrity and
        holistic development through heritage, culture, education, and
        eradication of poverty.
      </p>
      <p className="text-slate-600 mb-3">
        The foundation believes a country is not merely sand and brick, but its
        people and their way of life. Modern education often focuses on
        competition and material comfort, while the deeper relationship with
        self, community, and culture is neglected.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Heritage &amp; Culture</h2>
      <p className="text-slate-600 mb-3">
        India&apos;s richness lies in its heritage and culture, rooted in ancient
        philosophical traditions that offer timeless guidance to the world.
        Amurtha Bharathi seeks to preserve these traditions, customs, and
        values, so future generations can appreciate their beauty and depth.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Education</h2>
      <p className="text-slate-600 mb-3">
        Education is seen as a crucial investment for individuals, communities,
        and the nation. It equips people with knowledge and skills, supports
        social progress and economic growth, and empowers them to make informed
        decisions and overcome inequality.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Charity &amp; Service</h2>
      <p className="text-slate-600 mb-3">
        Charity is viewed as an expression of empathy and social
        responsibility—addressing immediate needs and upholding human dignity.
        Service to humanity, especially the poor and suffering, is regarded as a
        high form of worship and a path to spiritual expression.
